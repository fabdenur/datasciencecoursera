    "contents" : "# Let me show you an example of a function I'm going to make up called\n# increment(). Most of the time I want to use this function to increase the\n# value of a number by one. This function will take two arguments: \"number\" and\n# \"by\" where \"number\" is the digit I want to increment and \"by\" is the amount I\n# want to increment \"number\" by. I've written the function below. \n#\n# increment <- function(number, by = 1){\n#     number + by\n# }\n#\n# If you take a look in between the parentheses you can see that I've set\n# \"by\" equal to 1. This means that the \"by\" argument will have the default\n# value of 1.\n#\n# I can now use the increment function without providing a value for \"by\": \n# increment(5) will evaluate to 6. \n#\n# However if I want to provide a value for the \"by\" argument I still can! The\n# expression: increment(5, 2) will evaluate to 7. \n# \n# You're going to write a function called \"remainder.\" remainder() will take\n# two arguments: \"num\" and \"divisor\" where \"num\" is divided by \"divisor\" and\n# the remainder is returned. Imagine that you usually want to know the remainder\n# when you divide by 2, so set the default value of \"divisor\" to 2. Please be\n# sure that \"num\" is the first argument and \"divisor\" is the second argument.\n#\n# Hint #1: You can use the modulus operator %% to find the remainder.\n#   Ex: 7 %% 4 evaluates to 3. \n#\n# Remember to set appropriate default values! Be sure to save this \n# script and type submit() in the console after you write the function.\n\nremainder <- function(num, divisor=2) {\n  num %% divisor\n}\n",
